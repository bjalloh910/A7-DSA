I notice that no matter how big the input was the merge and quicksort were much more faster than selection sort and insertion sort. This makes a lot of sense because quicksort and merge are o(n * log n) time complexity. While Selection and insertion sort are o(n^2) time complexity. And based on Big O notation O(n * log n) is much more faster than O(n^2). This project overall wasn't too bad. I should had started it earlier.
